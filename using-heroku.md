Firefly III supports [Heroku](https://heroku.com//).

You can find Firefly III in Heroku by clicking this button:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/tree/master)

Any feedback you may have is welcome!

### Upgrade
I believe Heroku instances cannot be upgraded, but I'm not actually sure. I think you can simply install a new instance and use the old database.
