Tags are an extension of [categories]({{ 'guide-categories.html' | absolute_url }}) and meant to expand on the meta-data included in a [transaction]({{ 'guide-transactions.html' | absolute_url }}). You can add multiple tags to a transaction.

## Default tags

Regular tags can be useful to group expenses together, possibly in another context than your categories. For examples, tags might include:

* `too-expensive`
* `work-expense`

Or maybe something else entirely. This is up to you.

### Special tags

When you import data into Firefly III, a special tag will be created for each transaction. It is called `Import with key 'xxxx'` where the key is a custom code every time.
